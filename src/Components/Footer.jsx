          Louder Than Words is a campaign tool designed to empower grassroots
          organizations. It is designed only for progressive, anti-oppression
          based campaigns and reject all forms of classism, racism, sexism,
          colonialism, homophobia, transphobia or other bigotries. But as a
          volunteer-based team, we cannot vet every campaign. If you believe a
          campaign breeches our terms of service, please get in touch here:
